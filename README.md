# Superstore-EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)
In this project we will be performing EDA on the superstore data and we will draw meaningful insights from the data about the store items and sales. 

## What is data cleaning? 

- Data cleaning is one of the important parts of machine learning. It plays a significant part in building a model. 
-  It surely isn’t the fanciest part of machine learning and at the same time, there aren’t any hidden tricks or secrets to uncover.
- However, the success or failure of a project relies on proper data cleaning. 
- Professional data scientists usually invest a very large portion of their time in this step because of the belief that “Better data beats fancier algorithms”
- If we have a well-cleaned dataset, there are chances that we can get achieve good results with simple algorithms also, which can prove very beneficial at times especially in terms of computation when the dataset size is large.
